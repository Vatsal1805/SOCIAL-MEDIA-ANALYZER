# Development Approach - Social Media Content Analyzer



Our development approach centered on creating a scalable, AI-powered full-stack application using modern web technologies and best practices.

**Architecture:** We implemented a microservices architecture with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

**AI Integration:** Integrated Google Gemini AI API as the core analysis engine, with intelligent fallback mechanisms and mock services for reliable development and testing.

**Database & Storage:** Utilized MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data persistence and implemented robust file upload handling with support for images and PDFs using Multer, Tesseract.js for OCR, and PDF parsing capabilities.

**Frontend Development:** Built a responsive React 18 application with Vite build system, featuring professional UI, component-based architecture.

**Deployment Strategy:** Backend deployed on Render for reliable cloud hosting, frontend on Vercel for global CDN distribution. Environment-based configuration ensures seamless development-to-production workflows.

**Quality Assurance:** Implemented comprehensive error handling, loading states, professional code structure, and responsive design.

**User Experience:** Focused on intuitive interface design with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time analysis feedback, and actionable insights for social media content optimization.

The result is a production-ready application that provides valuable content analysis capabilities for creators and marketers.
